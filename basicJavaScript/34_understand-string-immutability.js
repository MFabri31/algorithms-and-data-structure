/*
In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.

let myStr = "Bob";
myStr[0] = "J";

Correct the assignment to myStr so it contains the string value of Hello World using the approach shown in the example above.

let myStr = "Jello World";

myStr = "Hello World";
